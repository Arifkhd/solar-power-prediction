☀ Solar Power Generation Prediction <br>
📌 Project Overview <br>
This project predicts solar power output based on historical environmental and operational data. The goal is to help understand power generation patterns and improve forecasting for energy planning and efficiency.
The project applies regression modeling techniques and includes full data analysis, model building, evaluation, and visualization.<br>

Datasets details: <br>
Column Name and Description<br>
distance-to-solar-noon -> Time difference from the solar noon of the given day<br>
temperature	 -> Ambient temperature at the time of measurement<br>
wind-direction	-> Direction of wind flow in degrees<br>
wind-speed -> 	Instantaneous wind speed<br>
sky-cover	P-> ercentage of sky covered by clouds<br>
visibility	-> Visibility in meters/kilometers<br>
humidity	-> Atmospheric moisture percentage<br>
average-wind-speed-(period)	-> Average wind speed over a given time period<br>
average-pressure-(period)	-> Average pressure recorded over a given time period<br>
power-generated	-> Target variable – solar energy produced<br>
